{"text": "The following describes a formal language called Grammar2.\n\nGrammar2 is based on color-shape agreement. A valid sentence consists of 1 to 4 color-shape pairs, where:\n\n1. Each pair must have a COLOR followed by a SHAPE\n2. RED can only be followed by CIRCLE or SQUARE\n3. BLUE can only be followed by TRIANGLE or DIAMOND\n4. Pairs can appear in any order\n5. The sentence must have between 1 and 4 pairs\n\nValid color-shape combinations:\n- RED CIRCLE\n- RED SQUARE\n- BLUE TRIANGLE\n- BLUE DIAMOND\n\nInvalid combinations:\n- RED TRIANGLE (RED cannot pair with TRIANGLE)\n- RED DIAMOND (RED cannot pair with DIAMOND)\n- BLUE CIRCLE (BLUE cannot pair with CIRCLE)\n- BLUE SQUARE (BLUE cannot pair with SQUARE)\n\nHere are examples of VALID sentences:\n\nRED CIRCLE\nBLUE TRIANGLE\nRED SQUARE BLUE DIAMOND\nRED CIRCLE BLUE TRIANGLE RED SQUARE\nBLUE DIAMOND BLUE TRIANGLE RED CIRCLE BLUE DIAMOND\n\nHere are examples of INVALID sentences and why they fail:\n\nRED TRIANGLE\n(Invalid: RED must be followed by CIRCLE or SQUARE, not TRIANGLE)\n\nBLUE CIRCLE\n(Invalid: BLUE must be followed by TRIANGLE or DIAMOND, not CIRCLE)\n\nRED\n(Invalid: incomplete pair - missing shape after color)\n\nCIRCLE RED\n(Invalid: wrong order - color must come before shape)\n\nRED CIRCLE BLUE TRIANGLE RED SQUARE BLUE DIAMOND RED CIRCLE\n(Invalid: too many pairs - maximum is 4, even though each pair is valid)\n\nTo determine if a sentence is valid:\n- Split into pairs (every two tokens)\n- For each pair, check the color-shape agreement\n- Count pairs - must be between 1 and 4\n"}
