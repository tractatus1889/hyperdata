# Project Instructions

- Do NOT run `git push` without explicit permission from the user.
- Code and filenames use "hyperdata" throughout. Markdown docs (reports, README) may use either "hyperdata" or "metaexamples" — the user is undecided on the final term. Follow whatever the user asks for in context.
